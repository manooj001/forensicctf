# The Stolen Cipher Challenge: Decrypt or Decaf?

## Challenge Overview:

So, you think you can outsmart the rival gang, huh? Congratulations on being our digital Sherlock! Your mission, should you choose to accept it (spoiler alert: you have no choice), is to decrypt the super-secret, highly-classified, and mildly intriguing message that the rival gang dared to steal.

## Challenge Details:

- **The Stolen Cipher:**
  The rival gang, clearly in need of a hobby, snatched a cipher straight from The Corleones' playbook. Inside the file named `index.html` lies the encrypted message. Decrypt it like your caffeinated existence depends on it.

## Question:

Decrypt the message in `index.html` and unveil the secrets within. What's the original plaintext? Feel free to channel your inner Godfather while you're at it.

## Hint:

Well, aren't you the detective extraordinaire? The Godfather adores family values, so maybe think "familial" when tackling this. Loyalty, love, and a dash of Mafia magic might just do the trick. Good luck, Capo!
